# I do not have Rust installed, now what?
This README provides some helpful hints how to participate in the workshop when
you do not have [Rust][rust] installed.

## Install Rust
Rust is an awesome language and [installing][install-rust] it is preferable.
This can be achieved by executing the following command

```shell
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

Unfortunatly, sometimes you just can't install Rust. What ever the reason,
whether it is the conference WiFi or you do not want to commit just yet, keep on
